Also studied was the impact of tree planting on reducing these peak flood flows.	Q1. Which subbasins are contributing a disproportionate amount of streamflow to peak flows in the Afon Leri catchmenTÅ· Q2. What impact does potential tree planting have on peak streamflows? 	How	What	"Hydrological modelling using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate and analyse subbasin level contributions to peak streamflows in through the village of Talybont. Three historical peak streamflow events were identified for study. The modelled streamflow was calibrated using historical gauged streamflow data and climate data from CAMELS-GB.  Further work utilised the Land Use Change SWAT+ Toolkit (LUCST) to make changes to the observed land use/land cover data, to simulate the impact of tree planting on streamflows."	Modelling	"Ordnance Survey Terrain 5 digital elevation model, CORINE Land Cover 2018 data, and EU Soil Database data, all for catchment setup and delineation.
